# Test Artifacts Directory

This directory contains test outputs and artifacts generated during testing.

## Contents

- `coverage.out` - Raw coverage data (generated by `go test -coverprofile`)
- `coverage.html` - HTML coverage report (generated by `go tool cover`)
- `*.log` - Test log files
- `*.tmp` - Temporary test files
- `testdata/` - Test data files (if needed)

## Usage

### Generate Coverage
```bash
make coverage
# Output: test/coverage.out
```

### View Coverage Report

open test/coverage.html
```

## Note

Test source files (`*_test.go`) are located in `src/` alongside the code they test, following Go conventions. This directory is only for test **outputs** and artifacts.
